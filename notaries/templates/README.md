# Overview
How to use these rubrics: 
- Once a prospective Notary has filed an issue to apply, their application will be publicly graded on the below criteria. 
- First, the applicant will be checked to see none of the criteria for [Automatic Disqualification](/notaries/templates#automatic-disqualification).
- Next, the applicant will be ranked based on their merits as a Notary. Note, per row the applicant can get a score 1-5. If an applicant does not provide evidence, they will get a 0 for that row. Definitions for terms used in the criteria can be found below the rubrics. 
- Once the applicant has been ranked as a Notary, the outputs are fed into the [Allocation Rubric](/notaries/templates#notary-allocation-plan-rubric). This considers the merits of the applicant as a Notary along with their previous track record, and the robustness of their plan to determine the [final allocation amount](/notaries/templates#final-allocation-amount).

All scoring decisions should happen in public on the issue as filed, and iteration (e.g. improvements to an allocation plan) may be made within the issue. Editors of the repo will be able to assign the final score based on the merits of the application. On a regular cadence, review of open applications can occur where scoring decisions can be reviewed. When a final score is determined, a label will be set such that Root Key Holders can be made aware action is required.

## Automatic Disqualification
The following criteria are grounds for automatic disqualification as a Notary:
- Being found to be in violation of Filecoin's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
- Severe or consistent acts of impropriety and abuse of one's role as Notary or as a Root Key Holder. Impropriety is defined as violating the Principles of this Mechanism, acting outside the remit of one's role (both as defined in this repository and as self-attested in the application process), or generally abusing the power entrusted to the role. Accusations of impropriety are expected to be filed via the [Disputes Mechanism](/README.md#dispute--audit-framework), where the accused will have an opportuntity to respond and justify their actions to the community.
